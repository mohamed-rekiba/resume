**Subject: Application for Senior Infrastructure Engineer Position**

Dear Prisma Hiring Team,

I'm excited to apply for the Senior Infrastructure Engineer role at Prisma. With 10+ years of experience building and scaling distributed systems across bare metal and cloud platforms, I'm drawn to your mission of making advanced database technology accessible to developers worldwide. Based in Istanbul (GMT +3), I'm perfectly positioned within your required timezone range. Your combination of open-source innovation with cutting-edge commercial solutions like Prisma Postgres resonates deeply with my technical philosophy.

## Why I'm a Strong Fit

**Distributed Systems & Cloud Architecture**
At Vertex Agility (McKinsey & Company), I architected HashiCorp Vault integration with Amazon EKS, implementing automated secrets management that reduced credential rotation efforts by 60%. Previously at Cequens, I led complete cloud migration from legacy infrastructure to AWS, achieving 99.9% uptime while reducing operational costs by 25%. This experience directly aligns with your needs for globally distributed configuration stores and resilient system design.

**Infrastructure as Code & Automation**
I've extensively used Terraform, Ansible, and custom automation tools to manage reproducible, scalable environments. At Cequens, I implemented automated DevOps pipelines that reduced deployment time by 70% and developed custom automation tools in Python, Golang, and Shell scripting that improved operational efficiency by 60%. I understand the importance of reducing maintenance overhead and provisioning times—challenges you've specifically highlighted.

**Linux & Networking Expertise**
My career began with deep Linux administration experience on CentOS and Debian systems, managing enterprise infrastructure across email, DNS, proxy servers, and private cloud solutions. I've configured load balancing solutions using Apache, Nginx, Traefik, and HaProxy, and implemented network security with pfSense and IPsec VPN.

**Security & Reliability**
I've strengthened security postures across multiple organizations by implementing OKTA/OIDC integration, vault identity groups, automated secrets rotation, and DevSecOps principles. At Vertex Agility, I developed comprehensive disaster recovery solutions ensuring business continuity, and created proactive monitoring achieving 99.9% network accessibility. I'm experienced with on-call rotations and understand the importance of work-life balance in reliability engineering.

**Container Orchestration & Modern Infrastructure**
I have hands-on experience with Kubernetes, EKS, ECS, and Docker, building containerized applications at scale. My work consolidating mono-repository architectures reduced deployment complexity by 30%, demonstrating my ability to simplify complex systems while maintaining reliability.

## What Excites Me About Prisma

The opportunity to work on Prisma Postgres and the bare metal cloud infrastructure powering it is compelling. Your challenge of deploying globally distributed configuration stores, improving server automation, and building cutting-edge containerization platforms aligns perfectly with my experience and interests. I'm particularly drawn to your emphasis on ownership, nimbleness, and kind collaboration—values that have defined my most successful projects.

**Open Source Contribution & Linux Passion**
My commitment to open-source extends beyond professional work. In 2009, I built Kenzy Linux, my own Linux distribution based on Fedora, creating custom package repositories on openSUSE Build Service. I've contributed to OBS itself, resolving RPM spec file processing issues, and have maintained packages for various open-source projects. This deep engagement with the Linux ecosystem and build systems demonstrates the passion for infrastructure and developer tooling that Prisma embodies.

As someone in the GMT +3 timezone (Istanbul, Turkey), I'm perfectly positioned within your required timezone range and can collaborate effectively with your distributed team. I bring an ownership mindset, adaptability to fast-paced startup environments, and a track record of making thoughtful trade-offs that drive meaningful impact.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience scaling infrastructure, automating operations, and building resilient systems can contribute to Prisma's mission of redefining how developers work with databases.

**Sincerely,**
**Mohamed Rekiba**
